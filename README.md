# RazorPay Landing Page

This is the clone project of the Razorpay landing page using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project replicates the classic, modern design and responsive layout of the original Razorpay website. 
HTML is used to structure the content, while Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling for quick, efficient design. 
Custom CSS is added to fine-tune the appearance, and JavaScript is implemented to handle any interactive features, such as animations or form handling. 
The result is a pixel-perfect, responsive, and functional clone of the Razorpay landing page.
